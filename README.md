### Description

TFS 3.11 will take any number of files - you can even right click a file and select 'Delete With TFS' - and overwrite them with random binary data up to several hundred times. The data overwrites every character in the file, so it is secure, but a bit slow. I've also included the DOD routine by Michael Bos as an alternate method of deletion. Also features a progress bar to show the deletion status and can scan drives for temp files.
